## Usage

Check your Python version and make sure version 3.7 or newer is installed on your system:

```shell
$ python3 --version
```

Install required python3 modules:

```shell
$ pip3 install pytz influxdb requests requests-cache instaloader trakt.py publicsuffix2 logging colorlog bs4
```

Run each Python script from the terminal and it will insert the most recent data into InfluxDB.

## Usage (Docker)

For running the trakt-tv script via docker.   This assumes a valid environment file with variables in it, see below.

```
docker run -i --env-file <name of .env file> <image location> python ./trakt-tv.py
```

Docker Envrionment file can contain specific variables rather than updating a config.py

```
TIMEZONE=America/New_York
TRAKT-CLIENT-ID=<your trakt key here>
TRAKT-CLIENT-SECRET=<your trakt key here>
INFLUX-HOST=
INFLUX-PORT=
INFLUX-USER=
INFLUX-PWD=
```



## Notes

* Each script is designed to write to its own InfluxDB database.  Using the same database name between scripts can lead to data being unexpectedly overwritten or deleted.
* RescueTime provides data each hour, so scheduling the script as an hourly cron job is recommended.
* Steam provides the recent playtime over 2 weeks, so the first set of data inserted will contain 2 weeks of time.  New data going forward will be more accurate as the script will calculate the time since the last run.
* Google Play doesn't provide total play time, only achievements and last played timestamps
* Instagram can take a very long time to download, so by default it will only fetch the 10 most recent posts.  Set `MAX_POSTS` to `0` to download everything.
* Access to the Todoist API requires a premium subscription

## Grafana Dashboards

The [grafana](grafana/) folder contains json files for various example dashboards.
Most dashboards require the `grafana-piechart-panel` plugin, and the Foursquaure panel also requires the panodata `grafana-map-panel` plugin:

```shell
$ grafana-cli plugins install grafana-piechart-panel
$ grafana-cli --pluginUrl grafana-cli --pluginUrl https://github.com/panodata/grafana-map-panel/releases/download/0.15.0/grafana-map-panel-0.15.0.zip plugins install grafana-map-panel plugins install grafana-map-panel
```
